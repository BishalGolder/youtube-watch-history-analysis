# YouTube Watch History Analysis

## Project Description  
This is a personal data analysis project exploring my YouTube watch history using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The analysis uncovers watch patterns, top channels, video trends, and session behaviors.

> **Note:** This repository does **not** include any personal data files (`watch-history.json`) to protect privacy.


## How to Download Your YouTube Data

1. Go to [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/).  
2. Deselect all and select only **YouTube and YouTube Music** data.  
3. Choose **All YouTube data included**, deselect all, and click **History**.  
4. Under **Multiple Formats**, scroll to the bottom and select the **History** dropdown to `JSON`.  
5. Download the exported archive when ready.  
6. Extract the `watch-history.json` file and place it inside a folder named `data/` in this project directory.
